              "'The apartment was as advertised and Frank was incredibly helpful through the entire process . I would definitely recommend this place .\\nIt was a pleasure to stay at Frank place . The place has everything you need to make it a home base to visit or work downtown . It is close to Maverick square which is min train ride to downtown Boston . Parking is a breeze here if you drive in , lot of street parking plus a private spot . Frank give you a lot of privacy and very knowledgeable about the area . I would stay here again next time I am in Boston .\\nThe apartment description is entirely faithful , and the building very well maintained . , laundry and other utilities are all very convenient . There is a nice view of the harbor from the back of the building , which lends itself well for a quiet , relaxing evening . Frank was very helpful throughout the duration of the stay . I recommend it in a heartbeat .\\nThoroughly enjoyed my time at Frank home . Had all amenities , was very clean and accommodating . I was very happy with the location and having private lock and gate parking . Lots of great food in the neighborhood and a fantastic view of the seaport . Theres a good chance I will be back in Boston next year for work and will definitely be looking to stay here again !\\nGreat value for the money ! This location has exceeding my expectations . . Photos do do justice to the place . It very cozy and homely . . The location is very convenient . It a five minute walk to the airport so you really do have to hire a cab to get to the house if you coming by plane . You can take the Silver Line bus from the airport , which takes you to South Station , with a stop at the Convention Center . The ride to the city is free ! Those buses take off every minutes or so . . Despite being close to the airport , the house is very calm , and I did have any trouble sleeping and I sensitive to noise , so it means that the place is indeed very calm . . Responsive but not overbearing host . A pleasure dealing with .\\nFrank was very accommodating throughout my stay in East Boston . He is easy to reach via text , phone , or email . Frank provided detailed instructions for entry allowing for a seamless transition from airport to residence . Upon entry it is clear that Frank takes pride in a clean and presentable home . If you in need of a home away from home whether for business or leisure this is your spot !\\nExcellent ! This was my second stay at the Jeffries St location and once again Frank was an extraordinarily helpful and accommodating host . If business brings me back to the East Boston area I will not hesitate reaching out for a third stay .\\nFrank was a wonderful and accommodating host . He was responsive to any questions I had . The place is exactly as described and pictured . It was very clean and orderly . When I arrived , the check in process was smooth and easy . The place is ideally located close to the Harbor Walk and a short walk away from water taxis and other public transport into downtown Boston . My three night stay was enhanced by the well equipped kitchen and restaurants in walking distance . It was perfect for my weekend in Boston !\\nFrank was great , the apartment has everything we need , including parking and the neighborhood is lovely ! So close to the water , restaurants , train and the airport min walk !\\nVery nice . Comfortable apartment . Good location . Frank is very nice person .\\nApartment was everything described . Very clean and within walking distance from the airport . Had to get on a bus to take you to the subway , which was sketchy at night . Other than that is was good .\\nFrank place is in a great part of East Boston . The location is nice and quiet the airport noise is really that bad here , but it pretty close to the blue line which makes it an easy hop into the city . There are great jogging trails nearby and the Pier Park around the corner is beautiful . It not a super fancy apartment but everything is in working order and it a comfortable place to stay . I also think you get good value for your money here since East Boston is still considerably cheaper than most of the rest of the city . Overall , I recommend the place !\\nFranks place is the ground floor unit in a storey wooden house , with Frank living upstairs . The apartment is comfortable and was ideal for my week stay with great cooking facilities and more spacious than a studio . It a few yards to the harbourside , and a minute walk to the airport . The nearest Metro station is about a mile away but then its just stop to Boston city . East Boston is a area that is due to its convenience and harbour views but do expect much in the way of trendy cafe or restaurants . The ones there are are typically Italian or Latino and cater to the locals rather than tourists . There is KO Pies nearby , run by a bunch of Aussies keen to educate New Englanders on the delights of the aussie meat pie , and well worth a visit . There are great parks nearby and excellent jogging routes . Franks place would suit a couple but not a family as there just one double bed . In terms of value for money , Franks is unbeatable and is a great place to base yourself for a Boston visit or a stay .\\nGreat place , amazing city , fantastic host ! ! !\\nTerry Hotel Alterntv in Boston was a perfect place to stay for myself and my partner . We mixed our trip with business and pleasure and found the room perfectly appointed for our needs and affordable . A great stay !\\nWarm and accommodating host . Beautiful and well appointed room .\\nWe stay nights at the Hotel Alternative and have complete confort , sweet bed and a very nice welcome . Close to the metro , here is the ideal place for a discovering trip town ! ! !\\nWe stayed in the private room . Terry provided a mini fridge and microwave , bath products , guidebooks , soft sheets and fluffy towels . We were very cozy despite it being a blustery winter weekend . Downtown Boston was visible from our room on the floor and , though the T was nearby , we enjoyed walking into town . What a good value we stay there again in a heartbeat .\\nStayed here recently during a conference and the accomodations were fantastic ! Terry is very laid back and very hospitable . The location is great . I used mass transit most of the time and the conference sites I visited were very accessible . I would highly recommend this experience as an alternative to an overpriced hotel .\\nMy partner and I stayed for a week at Terry during our vacation and it was a great experience . We were happy with our decision to stay there . The space is comfortable we were able to relax . The room is very close to the train , so it was easy to hop on the train and get around Boston and come back to our room whenever we wanted . We felt welcomed , safe , and comfortable . I would recommend it without hesitations .\\nTerry is welcoming and helpful . The condo was lovely thoroughly applianced kitchen , gorgeous bathroom , comfortable lounge and cosy bed . I felt very at home and it was easy to get in to Boston , with loads of useful information , mpas , books etc . The only small niggle is that the staircase to the bedroom was a surprise ! but otherwise thank you for a wonderful warm stay.\\nI stayed at Terry for nights . The guest room was great ! Very clean , and everything as promised was there . Terry attention to detail and small details were much appreciated . Much better value compared to a hotel ! Would definitely stay there again.\\nThis was a wonderful place to stay . The location was good , close to the train , and the place itself was beautiful , clean and just what we needed for our weekend away . We stayed in a smaller room the first night and then moved to a larger room after . It was nice to have the extra space and full kitchen . Although we did not see our host , we had plenty of communication via message as well as many things left for us in the room . Would definitely recommend .\\nStayed over Terry s place back in May , and we were very happy about the room . Terry is a very friendly and informative guy , and very quick in replying emails . He got maps , attraction spots and restaurant tips all planned out ready to pick up in the room , and he takes his time to explain to us where we were , and how to get to one point to another . The room we stayed was very charming and clean . It has everything you need , and we loved the bathroom . It is only minutes away from the subway station and bus stops , and takes only to minutes to go everywhere . Thanks a lot , Terry ! We had a good time .\\nA wonderful old house full of character . Terry was a very good host and was very helpful in all aspects . Our room was was five star , beautifully fitted out and extremely clean . I would recommend this accommodation to anyone . My only fault was that our apartment was at the top of two flights of quite steep stairs , so was a little difficult with suitcases .\\nthe only reason I have not given is although terry advertises under bed and breakfast no breakfast is i didnt read the info properly when i booked very nice room with tea and coffee provided june and john from barry south wales.\\nEverything was perfect about our stay at Terry place location was in a nice neighborhood just at the edge of the city , with a min subway ride to center city Boston the subway station is only a min walk from Terry place clean and comfortable room , with fresh sheets , towels , and everything else you might need for your stay tons of tourist guidebooks , toiletries , fridge , coffee maker , snacks , etc did not get to see Terry , but he was accessible by phone even at late hours and was very helpful in making sure we got into our room okay I highly recommend Terry place , and if you visit Boston definitely do the Freedom Trail Walk that starts at Boston Common !\\nI felt very welcomed at Terry Hotel Alternative , I felt like I was staying at a friends house . Terry provides plenty of local information , he very chilled and laid back and is very helpful . The location is great , less than minute walk to the Roxbury Crossing underground , although you can walk into town in about . I have no hesitation in recommending Hotel Alternative and would happily stay again if I back in Boston .\\nMy fiance and I could not have asked for more from our stay at the Fort Hill Inn . Terry , our host , was very welcoming as well as helpful , leaving us maps and suggestions of things to do . The room was beautiful , cozy and clean . The neighborhood was quiet and a great location a very easy , short trip to downtown . We will not only be staying here for future trips to Boston but will also be recommending it to any family or friends planning to visit the area .\\nVery comfortable , homely , quiet and private accommodation within easy walk of the Fridge and coffee maker as well as crackers provided . Stereo and TV . Walk up narrow flights of stairs to own apartment not a challenge , except when loaded with luggage and then not really ! Terry is very hospitable whilst not intrusive . Would stay here again .\\nThe place was perfect clean , comfortable , and conveniently located . Really private and cozy room ! We very much enjoyed our stay . Thank you , Terry !\\nEverything was just perfect Terry was a very friendly host and supplied us with lots of very useful information thank you !\\nThis is really a great location . The street is quiet and the room is really great . The bed is confortable . Terry is really helpfull . Enjoy .\\nWhen I first arrived we had a slight mix up with our dates but Terry soughted it all out for me within an hour and I was good to go ! The house has a heap of character and my room was a lot better than I had first expected . The bedroom was big , the shower had a tonne of pressure , and the bed was super comfy . I got an awesome nights sleep before having to fly half way around the world . Overall Terry is a top bloke and I would definately recommend his accommodation to anyone looking to stay in Boston . close to trains and buses as well .\\nNice and cozy room , tasteful decor . Very comfy to stay with cable , wifi and some snacks that Terry so thoughtfully provided . The level walk up can be a bit of a challenge if you have lots of luggage coming in or out . Overall , an enjoyable stay ! !\\nWe stayed nights and enjoyed it . The room is cosy and comfortable . There was everything you need . We could also store our baggage for some hours after check out . One star removed due to location . Seems a bit remote but easy access with tram .\\nLa habitación y el baño estaban limpios . La casa está muy cerca del metro , y a pocas paradas del centro de la ciudad . Terry nos recibió muy bien .\\nTerry was accessible and friendly . We had a great stay in Boston with no complaints . The location is in walking distance to the T and it worked well for us to explore the city . Thanks for a great stay , Terry !\\nIt the first time we been to Boston , and the place is much better than we expect . The host , Terry , was so friendly , and the set up of the room was amazing ! We enjoyed the stay there . Thanks to the host .\\nI stayed in Terry inn for a month . It was very comfortable enjoyable . It was located very close to the T stop , to the train station and also to the bus stop . It only took about by feet to the Brigham women hospital where I had to go everyday . Thank you Terry .\\nI came to Boston for some meetings and was looking for a quiet , private , and inexpensive place to stay and work . This fit the bill quite well . The place is really easy to get to on public transportation and Terry directions were perfect . It a quiet neighbourhood so if you looking to be right in the middle of things , you might want to stay closer to the city centre . But if you looking for a quiet place to stay with easy access to everything via the T , this is a great spot . Thanks Terry !\\nthe room is wonderful and very clean bathroom very nice and fully equipped min walk to metro and to center nice walk to center Boston quiet neibourhood Terry is very helpful didnt see him much but he left Boston documentation in room neiborhood is ok not in the missel of the city.\\nI had a really nice stay here for a little over two weeks , I was studying near the Brigham and Women hospital so the location was great for me considering I could walk there in about minutes . Terry was really good , always replying straight away if I needed anything . The place was really comfortable and homely so I recommend it to anyone .\\nThis is a great location to serve as base camp to explore Boston . The T is right down the hill , easy to find and quick to different parts of town . The room and bath were comfortable and we had good nights of rest . All in all it was a very fine place to rest and relax .\\nBoth of Terry apartments I stayed in were exceptional ! He sets the bar high on all fronts beautifully decorated , clean , spacious , comfortable , affordable full of amenities . Easy communication . Great location , lovely neighborhood FREE street parking practically in front of the place . The nights I stayed at the bedroom duplex apartment . My first night was at the tail end of a heat wave it was degrees out but Terry place was perfectly cool comfortable . The was on when I got there , with a few lights low background music making it very welcoming . The night I was in the Private Room Bath which was also very lovely . It was , and great to have the microwave and there and just about anything you could need in the cabinet . I slept well on the very comfy beds at both places . Glad I got to meet Terry as I was leaving though he had been available we communicated through text during my stay . Would highly recommend stay again , Thanks Terry !\\nHad a wonderful stay at Terry place in Fort Hill , Boston . Room was very nicely decorated and had excellent wifi . Bathroom was cool with an old tub . Bed was comfy and there was plenty of drawer space for my stuff . Terry was very charming and helpful as a host . HIghly recommend this place ! Parking is just a few feet away from the building and there were always spaces available . Also close to public transportation .\\nTerry welcomed us upon arrival and was extremely accommodating to our stay . We felt at home and our expectations were better than we imagined . The experience here was memorable and definitely a must to visit again . A FIVE star experience !\\nThe place were very clean , Terry was very nice and very very helpful in whatever you asked him I strongly recommend you guys to go there The place was near the T orange line minutes and it takes about minutes to reach BWH by bus and about minutes by feet . A lot of markets , restaurant around . It was a fantastic experience ! !\\nAmazing place for staying at Boston , strongly recommend , a hospitable host , a comfortable environment , a perfect rate .\\nI did have an opportunity to meet Terry , but my room at the Inn was very comfortable and well appointed . I appreciated the air conditioning on two of my three nights there , as the humidity was pretty high for the first few days of my visit . The well equipped kitchenette in the corner of the room came in handy too . I really enjoy staying in residential neighborhoods , rather than at big downtown chain hotels . This was ideal for me . The bed was extremely comfortable and there was a notebook with information about local restaurants and things to see . I did make use of that as I was here for a workshop , but it was a nice touch . A very charming place to stay . I stay there again next time I have to be in the Longwood Medical area .\\n'"

recently during a conference and the accomodations were fantastic   terry is very laid back and very hospitable   the location is great   i used mass transit most of the time and the conference sites

night and then moved to a larger room after   it was nice to have the extra space and full kitchen   although we did not see our host   we had plenty of communication via message as well as many things left for us in the room   would definitely recommend  \\nstayed over terry s place back in may   and we were very happy about the room   terry is a very friendly and informative guy   and very quick in replying emails   he got maps   attraction spots and restaurant tips all planned out ready to pick up in the room   and he takes his time to explain to us where we were   and how to get to one point to another   the room we stayed was very charming and clean   it has everything you need   and we loved the bathroom   it is only minutes away from the subway station and bus stops   and takes only to minutes to go everywhere   thanks a lot   terry   we had a good time  \\na wonderful old house full of character   terry was a very good host and was very helpful in all aspects   our room was was five star   beautifully fitted out and extremely clean   i would recommend this accommodation to anyone   my only fault was that our apartment was at the top of two flights of quite steep stairs   so was a little difficult with suitcases  \\nthe only reason i have not given is although terry advertises under bed and breakfast no breakfast is i didnt read the info properly when i booked very nice room with tea and coffee provided june and john from barry south wales \\neverything was perfect about our stay at terry place location was in a nice neighborhood just at the edge of the

for your stay tons of tourist guidebooks   toiletries   fridge   coffee maker   snacks   etc did not get to see terry   but he was accessible by phone even at late hours and was very helpful in making sure we got into our room okay i highly recommend terry place   and if you visit boston definitely do the freedom trail walk that starts at boston common  \\ni felt very welcomed at terry hotel alternative   i felt like i was staying at a friends house   terry provides plenty of local information   he very chilled and laid back and is very helpful   less than minute walk to the roxbury crossing underground   although you can walk into town in about   i have no hesitation in recommending hotel alternative and would happily stay again if i back in boston  \\nmy fiance and i could not have asked for more from our stay at the fort hill inn   our host   was very welcoming as well as helpful   leaving us maps and suggestions of things to do   the room was beautiful   cozy and clean

better than i had first expected   the bedroom was big   the shower had a tonne of pressure   and the bed was super comfy   i got an awesome nights sleep before having to fly half way around the world

comfy to stay with cable   wifi and some snacks that terry so thoughtfully provided   the level walk up can be a bit of a challenge if you have lots of luggage coming in or out   an enjoyable stay  \\nwe stayed nights and enjoyed it   the room is cosy and comfortable   there was everything you need   we could also store our baggage for some hours after check out   one star removed due to

about by feet to the brigham women hospital where i had to go everyday   thank you terry  \\ni came to boston for some meetings and was looking for a quiet   private   and inexpensive place to stay and work   this fit the bill quite well   the place is really easy to get to on public transportation and terry directions were perfect   it a quiet neighbourhood so if you looking to be right in the middle of things   you might want to stay closer to the city centre   but if you looking for a quiet place to stay with easy access to everything via the t   this is a great spot   thanks terry  \\nthe room is wonderful and very clean bathroom very nice and fully equipped min walk to metro and to center nice walk to center boston quiet neibourhood terry is very helpful didnt see him much but

stayed at the bedroom duplex apartment   my first night was at the tail end of a heat wave it was degrees out but terry place was perfectly cool comfortable   the was on when i got there   with a few lights low background music making it very welcoming   the night i was in the private room bath which was also very lovely   it was   and great to have the microwave and there and just about anything you could need in the cabinet   i slept well on the very comfy beds at both places   glad i got to meet terry as i was leaving though he had been available we communicated through text during my stay

restaurant around   it was a fantastic experience  \\namazing place for staying at boston   strongly recommend   a hospitable host   a comfortable environment   a perfect rate  \\ni did have an opportunity to meet terry   but my room at the inn was very comfortable and well appointed   i appreciated the air conditioning on two of my three nights there   as the humidity was pretty high for the first few days of my visit   the well equipped kitchenette in the corner of the room came in handy too   i really enjoy staying in residential neighborhoods   rather than at big downtown chain hotels   this was ideal for me   the bed was extremely comfortable and there was a notebook with information about local restaurants and things to see   i did make use of that as i was here for a workshop   but it was a nice touch   a very charming place to stay   i stay there again next time i have to be in the longwood medical area  \\n'"
